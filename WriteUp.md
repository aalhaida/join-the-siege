1. Handling Poorly Named Files

The original classifier relied solely on filenames to classify documents, which is ineffective when files are poorly named or misnamed. The updated code introduces content-based classification by extracting text from the file's content, allowing the classifier to analyze the actual document contents rather than relying on filenames.

Implementation:

Text Extraction Functions in extractors.py:

    extract_text_from_pdf(file): Extracts text from PDF files using pdfminer.
    extract_text_from_image(file): Extracts text from image files (PNG, JPG, JPEG) using pytesseract for Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
    extract_text_from_docx(file): Extracts text from Word documents using the docx library.

This allows the poorly named files to be classified correctly.

2. Scaling to New Industries

The updated code enhances scalability by using a modular design and content-based analysis, making it adaptable to new industries without significant code changes.

Implementation:

Modular Extractors:
    The extractors.py module is designed to handle various file types through separate functions, making it easy to add support for additional formats like Excel or CSV files.

Foundation for Advanced Analysis:
The code structure allows for the integration of advanced content analysis methods in the future, such as:
    Keyword extraction and matching within the extracted text.
    Machine learning models trained on document content.
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify and categorize documents.

This allows for Flexibility by allowing the classifier to be extended to recognize new document types from different industries by updating the content analysis logic, as well as, Maintainability through the use of a modular codebase simplifying the addition of new features and support for new industries.

3. Processing Larger Volumes of Documents

The code prepares the application to handle larger volumes by improving efficiency and setting up a structure conducive to scaling.

Implementation:

Efficient File Processing:
    Utilizes in-memory file processing with BytesIO, reducing disk I/O operations.
    Employs efficient libraries for text extraction, speeding up processing times.

Enhanced Error Handling and Logging:
    Incorporates error handling to catch and log exceptions, facilitating debugging and performance monitoring.

Modular Design for Scalability:
    The separation of concerns into app.py, classifier.py, and extractors.py allows for easy integration of asynchronous processing tools like Celery, which can distribute workloads and handle higher document volumes.

The application can be scaled horizontally by adding more worker processes or servers and improved logging and error handling help identify bottlenecks, enabling performance tuning for high-throughput environments.

Key Enhancements:
    Content-Based Classification:
        Shifted from relying on filenames to analyzing the actual content of files by extracting text using specialized functions for different file types.

    Modular and Extensible Design:
    Organized the code into separate modules:

        app.py: Handles the Flask web application and API endpoint.
        classifier.py: Intended for classification logic (currently to be updated for content analysis).
        extractors.py: Contains functions for extracting text from various file types.
    Foundation for Future Scalability:
        The modular structure and content extraction capabilities set the stage for integrating machine learning models and asynchronous processing to handle more complex classification tasks and higher document volumes.

Future Improvements:
1. Implement Machine Learning for Classification
    Collect a diverse set of documents representing each document type to classify and assign correct labels to each document based on its content.
    Use the existing text extraction functions to get text from each document.
    Clean the text by lowercasing, removing punctuation, stopwords, and applying stemming or lemmatization. (shown in the preprocessing.py module that was not used)
    train model (as shown in train_model.py)
    Load the Model and Vectorizer (as shown in classifierMLExample.py)
